* Always add new code from the `bottom` of the file, not in the `middle`.
* Never ignore `lint warnings`. `NEVER`.
* Use developer `logs`, `logs` and more `logs`.
* Use files and folders names in `LOWERCASE` except `vue` files.
* Always `beautify` your code.
* Always run `npm runt lint` before submitting a diff.
* If you are using `lodash`, require only the function you need, not the entire library.
* Do not attach `api response` to `this` if you have no intention of using it in html, use `let` instead of defining in data.
* There should be no `javascript` logic in `html`, all the logic has to be in `javascript` only and use the resultant in `html`.
* Always use `PascalCase` for `.vue` files.

Case types:
